    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value. In other words, it maps each possible value of the random variable to its corresponding probability.\n",
    "The PMF is denoted as P(X = x), where X is the random variable, and x is a specific value that X can take. The sum of all the probabilities in the PMF should be equal to 1.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. Let X be the random variable representing the outcome of the roll. \n",

    "The PDF is used for continuous random variables. Unlike the PMF, which deals with discrete values, the PDF gives the probability density at a particular value of the continuous random variable. The probability of the random variable taking on a specific value is represented by the area under the PDF curve within an infinitesimally small interval around that value.\n",

    "Example: For a fair six-sided die, the CDF would show the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to a given value.\n",
    "CDF tells us the probability that the outcome of the die is less than or equal to a specific value. For example, F(3) = 1/2, which means there is a 50% chance that the outcome of the die roll is 3 or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Probability Calculation: \n",
    "The CDF provides a convenient way to calculate the probability of a random variable falling within a range. For example, to find the probability of X being between a and b (P(a ≤ X ≤ b)), we can use the CDF: P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = F(b) - F(a).\n",

    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is widely used as a model in various fields due to its versatility and prevalence in natural phenomena. Some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model include:\n",

    "\n",
    "Together, the mean and standard deviation completely characterize the normal distribution, and their values determine the specific shape and location of the distribution curve. In the standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1), the curve is symmetric around the mean, with 68% of the data falling within one standard deviation from the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n"

    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that states that the sampling distribution of the sample means from a large number of independent and identically distributed random samples will tend to follow a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. This remarkable property holds true, especially when the sample size is sufficiently large.\n",

This normality assumption is essential for many statistical tests and confidence interval calculations.\n",

    "2. Sample Mean Estimation: \n",
