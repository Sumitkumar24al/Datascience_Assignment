    "\n",
    "**2. Unsupervised Learning Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Clustering:** Use clustering techniques such as K-Means to group similar data points together. Anomalies are data points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to very small clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Density Estimation:** Density-based methods like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) or Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) can be used to estimate the underlying data distribution. Points with low probability density can be considered anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving most of the information. Anomalies may be detected by looking at data points that deviate significantly from the reduced-dimensional representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Autoencoders:** Autoencoders, a type of neural network, can be used for unsupervised feature learning. Anomalies are data points for which the reconstruction error is high, indicating that they are not well-represented by the model.\n",

    "**3. Anomaly Detection Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Model Training:** Train your unsupervised learning model on the dataset, excluding the labeled anomalies (if any). The model learns the normal data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Anomaly Detection:** During testing or when evaluating the model on new data, calculate a measure of dissimilarity or distance from the learned normal data distribution for each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Thresholding:** Set a threshold or use statistical methods to determine when a data point should be considered an anomaly. Data points with dissimilarity scores above the threshold are flagged as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Alert or Action:** Anomalies are flagged for further investigation or action, depending on the application. In some cases, immediate action may be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, or the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Fine-Tuning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Continuously monitor the model's performance and fine-tune parameters or retrain the model as needed.\n",
